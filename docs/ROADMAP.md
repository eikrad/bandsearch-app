# Bandsearch Roadmap

## Completed (Phase 0-5)

- Monorepo foundation, CI baseline, Apache-2.0 licensing.
- Recommendation core with MusicBrainz + LangChain + Gemini.
- Explainable responses (`why`, `sourceTags`, `sourceSignals`).
- API hardening: structured errors, rate limits, timeout/retry, request logging.
- Desktop chat UI foundation: recommendation cards, mode switching, save/rate actions, feedback states.
- Preference memory: save bands, ratings, categories, notes.
- Search modes: `fresh` and `preference-aware` (preference context wired through to Gemini prompt).
- Persistence abstraction: `PreferenceRepository` interface with in-memory and Postgres implementations.
- Database-backed preferences (Postgres/Supabase) with migration script.
- E2E smoke tests covering the full preference-aware recommendation chain.
- Tauri desktop scaffold: native window, menu bar (About + Quit), API sidecar lifecycle (macOS + Linux).
- Playwright browser smoke tests: verify the built app actually renders in a real browser. ✓ Done.
- Compact card layout with `GenreChips`, `···` more button, and `PlatformLinks` action pills. ✓ Done.
- Saved Artists page: hash-based client-side routing (`#/`, `#/saved`), MusicBrainz artist search, directional selection (selected artists injected as priority preference context). ✓ Done.
- Artist pictures: Wikidata SPARQL with Last.fm fallback, lazy-loaded with graceful degradation. ✓ Done.
- Music platform links: deep search links for Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Spotify on every artist card. ✓ Done.
- Full chat interface: scrollable `MessageThread` with user bubbles and assistant recommendation cards; conversation history forwarded to Gemini via LangChain. ✓ Done.
- Session persistence: SQLite `chat_sessions`/`chat_messages` tables with in-memory fallback; session CRUD routes; `POST /recommendations` accepts `messages` array. ✓ Done.

## Phase 6 — Auth and Multi-user

- Multi-user support: auth/session layer and user-scoped preference ownership.
- User-linked preference schema evolution (`user_id`) and repository updates.
- API auth middleware and route protection for preference endpoints.
- Basic onboarding/login UX flow in the desktop client.

## Phase 7 — Platform Expansion

- Windows: Tauri already produces a Windows installer via `tauri build`; the main work is sidecar binary naming (`node-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` in `tauri.conf.json`) and adding a Windows runner to CI.
- Android: use Tauri's Android target (`tauri android init`). Voice input as the primary chat input method via the Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition`), which works natively in Chromium-based Android webviews — no native plugin needed. Requires responsive layout review and touch-friendly tap targets throughout the UI.

## Deferred / Under Review

- PWA client on shared API.
- Optional Spotify import with explicit user consent.
- Billing and subscription controls.
- Optional migration to Vertex AI governance mode.
