# Maintenance Log

Weekly dependency and health checks for the Bandsearch application.

---

## 2026-06-17

### Checks performed
- Reviewed all CI workflows — all passing (last successful run: 2026-06-17T13:42:21Z, branch: chore/branch-protection-workflow)
- Reviewed root `package.json`, `apps/desktop/package.json`, `services/api/package.json`
- Reviewed `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- Compared versions against current ecosystem state

### Fixes applied
No fixes needed this cycle.

### Dependency status
No changes to any dependency constraints since 2026-06-10. All packages remain on current major versions.

**Persistent note (dual lock files):**
`package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` still coexist at the repo root. CI uses `npm ci` so resolved versions may drift if contributors use pnpm locally. Consider consolidating to a single package manager when convenient.

### No major upgrades pending
All packages are on current major versions this cycle.

## 2026-06-10

### Checks performed
- Reviewed root `package.json`, `apps/desktop/package.json`, `services/api/package.json`
- Reviewed `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- Reviewed CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Compared versions across all workspaces

### Fixes applied

- **CI Node version (bug fix)** — Bumped Node from `20` to `22` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The root `package.json` declares `"engines": { "node": ">=22" }` but CI was running Node 20, meaning every CI run executed on a Node version the project explicitly does not support. This is now consistent.

### Dependency status

| `esbuild` | `^0.28.0` | Current |

**`apps/desktop` Rust (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`):**
Uses broad `version = "2"` constraints for tauri — resolved by `Cargo.lock`.

| Crate | Constraint | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `tauri` | `2` | Current |
| `tauri-build` | `2` | Current |
| `tauri-plugin-opener` | `2` | Current |
| `serde` / `serde_json` | `1` | Current |
| `dirs` | `5` | Current |

**`services/api` (`services/api/package.json`):**

| Package | Version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `express` | `^5.2.1` | Current |
| `zod` | `^4.4.3` | Current |
| `@langchain/langgraph` | `^1.3.2` | Current |
| `@langchain/google-genai` | `^2.1.31` | Current |
| `better-sqlite3` | `^12.10.0` | Current |
| `dotenv` | `^17.4.2` | Current |

| `express-rate-limit` | `^8.5.2` | Current |
| `@libsql/client` | `^0.17.3` | Current |
| `pg` | `^8.21.0` | Current |

### Notes

- **Dual lock files:** `package-lock.json` (root) and `pnpm-lock.yaml` both exist. CI uses `npm ci` (reads `package-lock.json`). If pnpm is used locally the resolved versions may differ from CI. Consider removing one set of lock files to avoid drift.

### No major upgrades pending
All packages are on current major versions this cycle.
